    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a passionate and driven student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Digital Business & Entrepreneurship at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. With a robust academic background in commerce, economics, and finance, I bring together strategic insight and creative thinking to build solutions that matter. From leading events in school to shaping impactful experiences in college, I have consistently demonstrated leadership, adaptability, and the ability to drive meaningful outcomes through collaboration and innovation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey includes participating in the prestigious AGILE COIL international collaboration program, where I worked on diverse global challenges with teammates from Japan, applying strategic thinking and cross-cultural communication. I am also spearheading a social-impact project focused on combating corruption through transparency and digital governance. With a desire to create real-world change, I aim to become a global citizen, leveraging technology, leadership, and entrepreneurship to uplift people and disrupt systems for good.
